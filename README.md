### Step 1: Get the code -

### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies

Laravel utilizes [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to manage its dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar.
Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to
usr/local/bin to use it globally on your system.
On Windows, you can use the Composer [Windows installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe).
Open terminal and go to the project foleder
Then run:

    composer dump-autoload
    composer install --no-scripts
	
	Note: If there is any error during composer update or composer install then run this following command.
	composer update --ignore-platform-reqs

### Step 3: Create database

Just go to the phpmyadmin and create the new database
After that, copy .env.example and rename it as .env and put connection and change default database connection name, only database connection, put name database, database username and password.

### Step 4: Install

Go to your cmd or terminal then type your project root path and after that type the following:

Now that you have the environment configured, you need to create a database configuration for it. For create database tables use this command:

    php artisan migrate

And to initial populate database use this:

    php artisan db:seed

If you install on your localhost in folder ProjectFolder, you can type on web browser:

	http://localhost/ProjectFolder/

OR Run the command " php artisan serve ", and open on the browser the url you get in console :):
